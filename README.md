RaspiSharp
==========

RaspBerry Pi interface for Mono

This is the first version of my own Raspberry interface for .net.

It uses the libbcm2835.so library for native operations, more info at http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835

Remember to execute your programs with elevated privileges or it will not be capable to access the hardware registers.

Use as you want, no copyright at all :D
